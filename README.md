# BambuStudio-ZAA

This is a fork of Bambu Studio that implements a non-planar slicing feature called Z anti-aliasing or contouring. The basic idea is to dynamically vary the height of extrusions within a single layer to reduce stair-stepping artifacts on top surfaces.

When starting the application, Z contouring can be controlled under the "Z Contouring" section in Global or Objects settings, under the Quality tab.



## Common Problems

If you are seeing poor quality extrusion, you may be printing too fast. Slow down outer and inner wall and top surface speed to 20 mm/s.

If you are seeing stringing, it may be due to collisions. If you try to extrude a line segment at high z and then try to extrude another line next to it at a low Z, the nozzle will collide with the previous extrusion, damaging it. Try reducing the number of wall loops to 1 or use outer/inner order of walls. The concentric top surface pattern can also cause this depending on the direction.

## Prior Work

This work is based on

- [[1609.03032] Anti-aliasing for fused filament deposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03032) by Hai-Chuan Song et al.

- [Theaninova/GCodeZAA](https://github.com/Theaninova/GCodeZAA) - GCode post-processing script to enable smooth(-ish) non-planar top surfaces

## Limitations

Collisions are currently not handled though a method of doing is described in the paper.

The algorithm performs a large number of ray intersection tests and this is done using a general purpose ray intersection algorithm. This can likely be sped up using a purpose-specific structure since the direction vector is always fixed.

## Original README

Bambu Studio is a cutting-edge, feature-rich slicing software.  
It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.

Prebuilt Windows, macOS 64-bit and Linux releases are available through the [github releases page](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases/).

Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/wiki) and the [documentation directory](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/tree/master/doc) for more informations.
